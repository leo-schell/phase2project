# Bottom Line
----

The Seattle Social Housing Authority should buy 1000 homes and rent them out to middle-income households.

This is the most ***cost- and time-effective*** option to free up entry-level affordable housing currently occupied by middle-income households. 

After an ***initial investment of $650-$950 million***, Seattle Social Housing will ***own these properties and collect rent***.
